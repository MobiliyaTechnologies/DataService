PiServer7(Data in interval of 15 minutes):
Make local server to your system say System1.
Create database same as the PiServer.

Update AppConfig file of Simulator say simulator1
PiConnectionString  = "data source=ajit-PC\SQLEXPRESS;initial catalog=PiTestCase1;persist security info=True;user id=sa;password=Mobiliya@123"

Update/uncomment code in GetPowerGridView class as per PiServer say piserver7.


PiServer8:
Make local server to another system say System2.
Create database same as the PiServer.

Update AppConfig file of another Simulator say simulator2
PiConnectionString  = "data source=KETANK-PC\SQLEXPRESS;initial catalog=PiTestCase1;persist security info=True;user id=sa;password=Mobiliya@123"

Update/uncomment code in GetPowerGridView class as per PiServer say piserver8.


Note: This simulator works with the current time same as the real system would be.

This updates/inserts table 'Powergridview','SensorData',and 'Weather'

This simulator based on the assumptions 
1 university 
2 campus
Each campus has 1 PiServers
Each campus/PiServer has 2 buildings say Chemistry building, Science buidling, Maths building, Physics building.
Each Buidling has 7 unique powerscouts.


So for 2 PiServer we have 28 unique powerscouts and 4 unique buidlings with 2 unique campuses.
