PiServer1:
Make local server to your system say System1.
Create database same as the PiServer.

Update AppConfig file of Simulator say simulator1
PiConnectionString  = "data source=KETANK-PC\SQLEXPRESS;initial catalog=PiTestCase1;persist security info=True;user id=sa;password=Mobiliya@123"

Update/uncomment code in GetPowerGridView class as per PiServer say piserver7.


Note: This simulator works with the current time same as the real system would be.

This updates/inserts table 'Powergridview','SensorData',and 'Weather'

This simulator based on the assumptions 
1 university 
1 campus
Each campus has 1 PiServers
Each campus/PiServer has 2 buildings say Chemistry building, Science buidling.
Each Buidling has 2 unique powerscouts.


So for 1 PiServer we have 4 unique powerscouts and 2 unique buidlings with 1 unique campuses.

Time required to process data:
1 day data: 10 minutes approx.
1 week data: 46 minutes approx.
2 week data: 101 minutes approx.(55 minutes approx.)
3 week data: 157 minutes approx.(56 minutes approx.)
4 week data:  221 minutes approx. (64 minutes approx.)

Note: This data depends on network stability.
