PiServer1(last 3 months data):
Make local server to your system say System1.
Create database same as the PiServer.

Update AppConfig file of Simulator say simulator1
PiConnectionString  = "data source=KETANK-PC\SQLEXPRESS;initial catalog=PiTestCase1;persist security info=True;user id=sa;password=Mobiliya@123"



Note: This simulator works with the current time same as the real system would be.

This updates/inserts table 'Powergridview','SensorData',and 'Weather'

This simulator based on the assumptions 
1 university 
1 campus
Each campus has 1 PiServers
Each campus/PiServer has 1 buildings say Chemistry building.
Each Buidling has 7 unique powerscouts.

So for 1 PiServer we have 7 unique powerscouts.
